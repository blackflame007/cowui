## Features

- ü§ñ Connect to AI agents via a simple API
- üñºÔ∏è Messages displayed through ASCII art characters (featuring Bender!)
- üë• Select from multiple available agents
- üí¨ Persistent chat history during session
- üé® Clean, modern terminal UI using Bubble Tea and Lipgloss

## Installation

```bash
go install github.com/blackflame007/cowui@latest
```

Or build from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/blackflame007/cowui.git
cd cowui
go build ./cmd/cowui
```

## Usage

Start the client with:

```bash
cowui
```

### Controls

- **Type** to compose a message
- **Enter** to send a message
- **Up/Down** to navigate agent selection (when multiple agents are available)
- **Ctrl+C** to exit

## Requirements

- Go 1.20 or higher
- A running agent server (default: http://localhost:3000/api)

## Configuration

The agent server URL can be configured by modifying the `apiBaseURL` constant in `main.go`.

## How It Works

CowUI connects to a local API server that hosts AI agents. Messages are sent to the selected agent, and responses are displayed in the terminal with ASCII art using a customized version of cowsay.
